# Welcome

This project introduces the Ohio Black press in the 19th century so that we can understand early African Americans' civic engagements that have defined American democracy in practice. People of African descent in the 19th-century U. S. did not perceive freedom limited to a government-sanctioned right, as the Constitution described the body of citizens too vaguely to ensure their civil rights. Rather, against systemic oppressions in the country, African Americans envisioned freedom involved with communal works that would actualize ideals of a democratic society. This project offers informative and interpretative descriptions of the newspapers to show dynamic communal life of 19th-century Black Ohioans. It also uses quantitative methods with data and digital visualization to make explicit what, like early Black communities in the Midwest, has been considered hard to trace because of the lack of records. In doing so, the project shows one example of how African Americans legitimized their sovereignty by demonstrating civic qualification as a response to and beyond the government system that had failed to maintain its constitutional promise on human rights.
